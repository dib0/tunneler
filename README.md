# Tunneler

This project is a remake of Geoffrey Silverton's classic [Tunneler](https://tunneler.org) game for DOS. The game is developed as a HTML5 Canvas and Javascript app, with a small node.js server that facilitates communication between the players. The graphics are a bit different from the original, and some gameplay elements are changed (for example, the map is not randomly generated) but the basic gameplay is the same.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file.

← `index.js`: The node.js script that runs the server.

← `index.html`: This file is served by the node.js server and contains the page with the game.

← Other .js files: These files contain the actual logic of the game.
