# Tunneler

This project is a remake of Geoffrey Silverton's classic [Tunneler](https://tunneler.org) game for DOS. The game is developed as a HTML5 Canvas and Javascript app, with a small node.js server that facilitates communication between the players. The graphics are a bit different from the original, and some gameplay elements are changed (for example, the map is not randomly generated) but the basic gameplay is the same.

You can play the game on Glitch.com: [https://tunneler.glitch.me](https://tunneler.glitch.me)
